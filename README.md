# Composite-Wave-Plate Article
This repository consits of a Python Module associated with the article _add doi & article name_. This module contains an alegbraic method based on quaternions to describe coherent polarization states, waveplates and composite waveplate systems and the transformations.

In the _main_ folder you can access to the python module created to perform the quaternion description of polarized light and its transformations through composite waveplate systems.
